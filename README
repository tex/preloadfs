Problems:

Requires:

	fuse >= 2.5
	boost >= 1.35.0 (Boost.Asio required)

Compile:

	Boost's libraries may be stored in /usr/lib64 on 64bit systems,
	configure script needs to be called with:

	./configure --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib64/

	Don't use --enable-debug flag. Build fails during linking with boost
	libraries.

Usage:

	preloadfs [options] fileToMount mountPath

	Options:
	  --fileToMount arg     file to mount (local file or HTTP URL)
	  --mountPoint arg      mount point
	  -t [ --tmp ] arg      temporary path for a buffer
	  -b [ --buffer ] arg   buffer size in KiB
	  -d [ --debug ]        turn on debug mode
	  -h [ --help ]         print this help
